# Creation of a Membrane Protein Extended Topology Standard

* Goal is to create a flat file extensible format standard focused on membrane protein topologies that incorporates information on sequence, structure, core hydrophobic regions, full TM domains, loop regions, ECD domains, head/neck/stalk/stem regions, etc.
* The topological information of individual domains will be combined with other features of iCn3D like sequence conservation and interaction analysis to create hypotheses on the structural and functional role of each of the topological domains.
